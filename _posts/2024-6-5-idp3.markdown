We developed the Improved 3D Diffusion Policy (iDP3), a 3D visuomotor policy that enables humanoid robots to perform autonomous tasks in varied real-world settings. Unlike traditional models, iDP3 operates without the need for camera calibration or point-cloud segmentation by utilizing egocentric 3D visual representations. This approach allows for effective performance using only lab-collected data.
