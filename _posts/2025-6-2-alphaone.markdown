This paper introduces AlphaOne, a test-time framework that controls the reasoning speed of large models using a universal α parameter. It gradually inserts "slow thinking" steps before α and then switches to fast reasoning after α. AlphaOne improves both reasoning quality and efficiency across math, coding, and science tasks.
