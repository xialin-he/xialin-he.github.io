We present OmniH2O (Omni Human-to-Humanoid), a learning-based system for whole-body humanoid teleoperation and autonomy. Using kinematic pose as a universal control interface, OmniH2O enables various ways for a human to control a full-sized humanoid with dexterous hands and also enables full autonomy by learning from teleoperated demonstrations or integrating with frontier models such as GPT-4o
