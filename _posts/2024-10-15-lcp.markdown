We introduce Lipschitz-Constrained Policies (LCP), a method for achieving smooth locomotion in legged robots by enforcing a Lipschitz constraint on the policy. LCP eliminates the need for non-differentiable smoothing techniques, offering a simpler and robust solution applicable across diverse humanoid robots.
